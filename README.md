# Motor Vehicle Crash Analysis in New York City

## Overview

This project analyzes motor vehicle crashes in New York City during the year 2018. The primary objectives are to understand spatial and temporal patterns in crash occurrences and to provide insights that can inform urban planning, safety measures, and traffic management. The dataset used for this analysis is sourced from New York Open Data.

## Data

### Dataset Source

The dataset used for this analysis was obtained from [New York Open Data](https://opendata.cityofnewyork.us/). It contains detailed information on motor vehicle crashes in New York City, including date, time, and location (latitude and longitude)

### Data Cleaning

Prior to analysis, the dataset was cleaned to:
- Focus solely on the year 2018 to reduce processing time and enhance analysis efficiency.
- Exclude invalid latitude and longitude values, ensuring data accuracy.
- Subset the data into four seasons (Fall, Winter, Spring, and Summer) for temporal analysis.

## Analysis

### Spatial Analysis

A heatmap was generated to visualize the spatial distribution of motor vehicle crashes across New York City. Key findings include:
- High crash prevalence in midtown Manhattan, attributed to its dense population, tourist attractions, and public visibility.
- Continued crash occurrences in upper Manhattan after Central Park.
- Lower crash rates in the eastern part of the city, possibly due to commuting patterns and workplace density downtown.

### Temporal Analysis

The dataset was divided into four seasons to explore temporal patterns. Key insights include:
- Highest crash occurrences during the fall months in midtown Manhattan.
- More dispersed crashes in residential areas during winter, likely influenced by weather conditions.
- Consistent patterns in spring and summer, with crashes concentrated in dense roadway areas and inner city regions.

## Results

The results of this analysis offer valuable insights into motor vehicle crash patterns in New York City during 2018. Key findings can inform various applications, including urban planning, traffic management, safety initiatives, and resource allocation.

## Applications

### Urban Planning

- The identification of crash hotspots can guide urban planners in implementing safety measures and traffic calming strategies in high-risk areas.

### Traffic Management

- Insights into temporal patterns can help optimize traffic management strategies during different seasons, improving response times and resource allocation.

### Safety Initiatives

- Data-driven insights can inform safety campaigns and initiatives, targeting specific areas and seasons with higher crash rates.
